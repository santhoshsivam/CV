                    <p>The basic CV page was built and developed by me after all the struggles.The things that's gone good and lots and lots of
                    learning is gained over by the mistakes.After all that I learnt more about this domain and my webpage is hosted
                    successfully.</p>
                    <p>think this was a failing on my part - not encouraging or giving them space to contribute and feel comfortable asking

        <div class="wip-same-p">
            <p>In that time I was doing about the back-end learning.But in my home things didn' t perfect at that time.My parents are
            advised me to go for a work belonging to my studies,because im a mechanical engineer.But my interests is towards
            computer so I just had to convince my parents to do and achieve in this domain.So in that period I just Survived towards
            my dream.</p>
            <p> Does anyone else have music that they only listen to when they are working? For me, specifically with coding, Iâ€™m all
            about Retro and Synthwave. Dancy, minimal vocals, high BPM. Perfect coding music!</p>

            <p>Coding is the only entertainment on those days.Because the LAHTP is gone on with very busy schedule.Because class is on
            every day,what he teaches we have to practise on the next day so there is no other time for other works.I just coded
            during those days.

            <p>This is the month where my carreer starts.I joined on LAHTP with SIBIDHARAN NANDHAKUMAR.The things that he taughted to
            us which will fast forwarded our carrer and what he taught is boost up interests towards this domain, and it courses me
            the direction how we want to go.What we learnt:Developed a site from scratch with back and front end and we started to
            put some attacks for secure coding practises,learnt 4+ languages to code for life.

            <p>During the lockdown,All I do is a watching the tv and simply roaming in the home and hearing the same music over again
            and again and simply dumped to move a day.After sometime,I got some thought, why dont to utilize this lockdown to
            develop the carreer towards this domain? and started to learn python in mobile phone and writes my first "Hello World"
            program in that.And I really just started to move my time and later I got addicted. </p>
